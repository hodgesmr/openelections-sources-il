# OpenElections Sources IL

Source files for Illinois election results. 

Many of the files in "County-level files for processing" were contributed by [Michael W. Sances](http://umdrive.memphis.edu/msances/www/), an assistant professor of political science at the University of Memphis, who obtained them for his dissertation research on local elections. His research was [funded by the National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1223187). OpenElections is grateful for his generous contribution towards our work.

2016 precinct-level files for Cook County and Chicago are from the [Chicago board of elections](http://www.chicagoelections.com/en/home.html) and the [Cook County clerk](http://www.cookcountyclerk.com/elections/pages/default.aspx).
